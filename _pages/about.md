Originally from Santa Cruz, CA, I recently graduated from UCSC with a B.S. in Marine Biology. Now I am on to the next step as a JD student in Vermont in hopes of becoming an Environmental Lawyer.  From there, I want to become an even bigger advocate for marine and coastal conservation - both nationally and globally.  With a variety of unique opportunities to travel and witness the beautiful natural diversity this world has to offer, I have turned my passion for nature into an art form via photography.  By doing so, I am able to share areas of this world that you might not otherwise be able to visit or see on your own.  I hope to pass along the need to travel and explore the world through your own eyes as a result, and hopefully to grow an understanding and appreciation for all nature around you.  Taking a moment to view the little details and "smell the roses", gives you insight into a completely different world that you didn't even know was around you.  Through inspiration, curiosity, education and appreciation, we will be able to help protect all that our world has to offer us for not only our generations, but future ones as well.  This site is where I hope I can get you inspired to make a difference too!
